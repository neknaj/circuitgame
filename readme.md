Circuit Game is a simulation tool for designing and testing digital circuits. It allows users to define modules, gates, and tests for their circuits and provides tools for compiling and testing these designs.

## Installation

To install the project, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/neknaj/circuitgame.git
    cd circuitgame
    ```

2. Install dependencies:
    ```sh
    npm install
    ```

3. Build the project:
    ```sh
    npm run build
    ```

## Usage

### Command Line Interface

The project includes a command-line interface for compiling and testing circuits. Use the following command to see the available options:
```sh
cargo run -- --help
```

### Web Interface

To use the web interface, open `index.html` in your browser.  
Currently, you can only view the output in the Developer Tools console.

## Notation

The circuit notation grammar is defined using a BNF-like syntax.  

For a detailed BNF grammar, refer to the `lang.bnf` file in the `spec` directory.  
For the actual implementation, see the `parser.rs` file in the `src/compiler` directory.

### Sample Code

For more examples, see the `sample.ncg` file in the `spec` directory.
```ncg
using nor:2->1;

// This is a NOT gate module
module not (x)->(a) {
    a: nor <- x x;
}
// Providing tests for the not module
test not:1->1 {
    t -> f;
    f -> t;
}
```
